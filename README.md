# Electrical Engineer Portfolio (Next.js + Tailwind)

This is a minimal Next.js (pages router) project pre-configured with Tailwind CSS—ready for local development and Vercel deployment.

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Notes
- Replace `public/resume.pdf` with your actual resume.
- Edit `pages/index.jsx` to update content, projects, images, and links.
- This project uses Tailwind; if you want the app-router variant or additional pages, tell me and I'll update the ZIP.
